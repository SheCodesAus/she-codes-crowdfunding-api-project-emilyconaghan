# She Codes - Django DRF Project

Hi! This is part A of my crowdfunding project. 

Part A is built using Django Rest Framework and is the backend of the project. 


# Hosting

The project is hosted on Heroku, you can access the project via:
https://sleepy-chamber-04622.herokuapp.com/

# Insomnia

Using insomnia, I have been able to demonstrate the functionality of the application through various GET and POST methods. 

# Features

In the applications current state, the following features are present: 

 - The ability to return all projects
 - The ability to create a new project
 - The ability to return specific projects via an ID number
 - The ability to create a new pledge
 - The ability to call on a specific pledge using an ID number
 - The ability to return all users
 - Creating an authorisation token

# Future Iterations

At this stage, the project is currently in MVP form. My intention is to expand to include the following features: 

- The ability to update a specific project
- The ability to delete a project
- Filtering ability (by location, owner etc.)
- Sorting functionality (newest to oldest, amount to target)
- Contact form where users can get in touch with the project owner

## Any questions?

If you've got any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them!
